## Research Questions: Which countries were the happiest before the COVID pandemic (2018-2019)? Which countries were the least happy? Did these trends change after the pandemic hit (2020-2021)?

Geomap shows the top happiest countries and least happy countries during these time periods. Markers and different tile layers show which countries were the happiest and least happy over time.
